This is a brief description of how to install AUC-TeX under MS-DOS. It
describes how to install AUC TeX version 9.1i using the OEMACS editor,
but it is unlikely that this will fail if you use GNU Emacs 19.XX
compiled for MS-DOS, it might even work with DEMACS.

DISCLAIMER: I have no connection with the AUC-TeX maintainers, so this
document may not be up to date, hopefully the installation procedure
will not change too much.

NO WARRANTY: If following these instructions causes a king-size
disaster, it's just tough luck. There is no warranty, but you'll get
my sympathy :-)


STEP 1. Install the files at your PC. You can obtain AUC TeX by
	anonymous ftp from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.zip.
	Unpack the file using "pkzip -d auctex" from your site-lisp
	directory (probably called "c:\emacs-19.19\site-lis"). The
	"-d" is important to avoid getting everything in one
	directory. AUC TeX will be installed in the subdirectory
	auctex-9.1i (yes, this *IS* a valid DOS directory name)

STEP 2.	Customize tex-site.el: (If you are updating AUC-TeX you may
	already have a working tex-site.el in your site-lisp directory,
	but you'll better read this anyway to check the file.)

	Edit the definition of TeX-lisp-directory in tex-site.el: It
	should contain the path to the directory where AUC-TeX is
	found, probably something like this:

(defvar TeX-lisp-directory "c:/emacs-19.19/site-lisp/auctex-9.1i/"
  "*The directory where the AUC TeX lisp files are located.")

	Copy the definition of TeX-macro-global from tex.el to
	tex-site.el and edit it to reflect where the (La)TeX files are
	found:

(defvar TeX-macro-global
  '("f:/emtex/ownsty/" "f:/emtex/latex2e/" "f:/emtex/texinput/")
  "*Directories containing the sites TeX macro files and style files.

The directory names *must* end with a slash.")

	Copy the definition of TeX-command-list from tex.el, and
	update it to reflect the names of the commands you use to call
	latex, the dvi viewer etc. You should remove the single quotes
	from the command lines, since they are not removed by
	COMMAND.COM, and it is not necessary to prevent COMMAND.COM
	from interpreting the command line. You should also remove
	lines that will not work under MS-DOS, such as (La)TeX
	Interactive and Spell. I ended up with this definition:

(defvar TeX-command-list
  ;; You may have to remove the single quotes around the command
  ;; arguments if you use DOS.
  (list (list "TeX" "tex \\nonstopmode\\input %t" 'TeX-run-TeX nil t)
	(list "LaTeX" "%l \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}" 'TeX-run-LaTeX nil t)
	(list "LaTeX2e" "latex2e \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}"
	      'TeX-run-LaTeX nil t)
	(list "View" "dviscr @f:\\emtex\\lj.cnf /o:4 /fl:-1 %s" 
	      'TeX-run-command t nil)
	(list "Print" "%p " 'TeX-run-command t nil)
	(list "File" "dvips %d -o %f " 'TeX-run-command t nil)
	(list "BibTeX" "bibtex %s" 'TeX-run-BibTeX nil nil)
	(list "Index" "makeindex %s" 'TeX-run-command nil t)
	(list "Check" "lacheck %s" 'TeX-run-compile nil t)
	(list "Other" "" 'TeX-run-command t t)
	;; Not part of standard TeX.
	(list "Makeinfo" "makeinfo %t" 'TeX-run-compile nil t)
	(list "AmSTeX" "amstex \\nonstopmode\\input %t"
	      'TeX-run-TeX nil t)))

	Note that I have not copied the long documentation string, so
	the variable will not be documented until AUC-TeX is loaded.

	Test if the file can be read (M-x load-file tex-site.el), then
	copy tex-site to your site-lisp directory, so Emacs can find
	it. If you are lucky you can reuse it when you update AUC-TeX.
	If the file cannot be loaded you may have a mismatched
	parenthesis.


STEP 3.	[ Fixed in 9.2 --Per ]


STEP 4.	Add the following line to your _emacs file:
	(require 'tex-site)
	You may also want to add these lines:
	(setq tex-default-mode 'latex-mode)
	(setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)


STEP 4.	Byte-compile AUC-TeX: Go to the auctex directory, start Emacs,
	load the file lpath.el (M-x load-file), then byte-compile
	everything in the directory (C-u 0 M-x
	byte-recompile-directory).


STEP 5. [OPTIONAL]
	EITHER:
	Compile the LaCheck utility using your favourite C compiler.
	Look in the .../auctex/lacheck/makefile file to see what should be
	done. I have not tried this, but I cannot see any reasons why
	it should not work.
	OR:
	Ftp a copy of a DOS binary from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/packages/LaCheck.
	[ This is an old version --Per ]


STEP 6.	[OPTIONAL]
	Print the manual. If there is no .dvi file in the doc
	directory, you'll need texinfo version 2.16 or later. You'll
	also need the texindex program (part of texinfo?).
	To make the dvi file type:
		tex auc-tex
		texindex auc-tex.ky
		texindex auc-tex.fn
		texindex auc-tex.vr
		texindex auc-tex.cp
		tex auc-tex

	(Note: I haven't tested this under MS-DOS, since I don't have
	the texindex program). The manual is worth reading, AUC-TeX
	can do thing you wouldn't suspect you need :-)


STEP 7. [OPTIONAL]
	Install the info files: Move them to your info directory, and 
	add the following line to the menu in the dir file:

* AUC TeX: (auctex).	AUC TeX. Improved TeX/LaTeX mode.


STEP 8. [OPTIONAL] 
	Parse the (La)TeX macros and sty files. This is necessary if
	you want macro completion, but will require some time and a
	lot of swap space. It will consume half a megabyte disk
	space. Just type M-x TeX-auto-generate-global, and go reading
	a good book: "War and Peace" and "The Lord of The Rings" have
	approximately the right length :-).

	If you get the error message "Creating directory: access
	denied, c:/..../auctex-9.1i/auto" the directory already
	exists. Remove it and try again. If Emacs crashes you probably
	ran out of virtual memory.

	Note: This is likely to generate a directory with more that
	255(?) files, causing MS-DOS 5.1 to be very inefficient. The
	solution is to delete the .el files and clean up the
	directory. I did it like this (from the auctex directory):
		xcopy auto\*.elc auto2\
		del auto
		rd auto
		xcopy auto2 auto\
		del auto2
		rd auto2
	Note: Look at what happens when the first xcopy writes the
	files. If it suddenly becomes slower you still have too many
	files, and should delete some of them (there must be some
	.sty files you never use, delete the corresponding .elc file).
	This may anyway be a good idea to speed up loading. Removing
	the .el files and half the .elc files this way speeded the
	loading of the .elc files for my thesis up from 58 seconds to
	12 seconds!


The whole package will use 1.2 MB of your precious harddisk space ---
but it's worth it! You could of course compress / delete everything
except the .elc files (250 kB). I haven't tried this (yet), so I don't
know if it has disastrous side effects.

PROBLEMS: I have experienced the following problems, they are probably
related to OEMACS and/or emTeX and not to AUC-TeX:

1) When you have viewed the dvi file, and the screen is returned to
text mode, the creen is not repainted. Press C-l to refresh the
screen.

2) If LaTeX, the dvi viewer etc. cannot find a file name, it will try
to read a name from the keyboard via stdin, and hang. C-break can
often save the day. My dvi viewer has no problems reading the keyboard
once it has started since it then uses direct keyboard reads. 

3) If the dviscr (my dvi viewer) doesn't find a font, it asks for a
replacement font. This should be disabled by setting batch-mode in the
configuration file (the "/fb" option). Also, you should not enable
metafont-mode (the "/fm" option), since this will cause dviscr to ask
you if it should write a MFjob input file if a font is missing. This
will cause Emacs to hang.

4) When the dvi viewer terminates, it changes from graphics mode to 25
lines text mode. If Emacs was in 43 or 50 lines mode, the screen is
now in 25 lines mode, but Emacs believes there are 43 (50) lines!
This has been reported to Darryl Okahata (the OEMACS maintainer), and
may be fixed in future versions of OEMACS.
