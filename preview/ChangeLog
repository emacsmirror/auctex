	tex-site.

	* Makefile.in (use-hint): Get line wrapping right.

	* configure.in (--with-texmf): Applied patch from Hans Fredrik

	account that we previously got only half of requested width.

2001-11-10  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx (subsection{The internals}): Make reassignment of
	\@tempboxa that lead to missing section headers local.

	preview-scale-function is a constant instead of a function.

2001-11-06  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4 (AC_CHECK_AUCTEX): Revert the previous change, since
	it was horribly broken, and fix --with-auctex, so that it doesn't
	do the check if --with-auctex was specified.

2001-11-06  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4 (AC_CHECK_AUCTEX): Try looking for tex-site instead
	of tex-buf... this may help since we're sure it's in load-path,
	but I'm afraid that the contents of tex-site may not be standard
	enough across installations.
	

2001-11-06  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.el (preview-image-creators): Add preview-eps-open
	function for calling dvips conversion.
	(preview-eps-open): Resume half-hearted support of postscript
	image type.  Does anybody use this, after all?  If so, let him
	run DviPS in background if he so desires...

	* preview.dtx (subsection{The internals}): add \leavevmode to make
	things like \paragraph flush their \everypar tokens.  Perhaps not
	the right thing to do, let's wait for error reports about that
	one.

	* preview.el: require 'tex-site when compiling
	(preview-gs-file): new local variable
	(preview-gs-sentinel): cater for "Compilation" flag in mode-line

	(preview-dvips-command): New option for dvips call
	(preview-parse-messages): add message while parsing
	(preview-parse-messages): remove call to open, this calls parsing
	instead.
	(preview-start-dvips): New function.
	(preview-TeX-inline-sentinel): Changed to new process model
	Note: this breaks 'postscript image support.  To be fixed.
	
2001-11-03  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4
	(AC_CHECK_PROG_REQUIRED,AC_CHECK_PROGS_REQUIRED,AC_PATH_PROG_REQUIRED):
	New functions to check programs, and abort with a message if not
	found.
	(AC_EMACS_CHECK_LIB): Function stolen from Gnus to check whether
	an elisp library exists.
	(AC_CHECK_AUCTEX): Check if AUC-TeX is in a normal emacs load
	path, and allow --with-auctex switch to specify it. SF Bug
	#477262, #477260.

	* Makefile.in (use-hint, install-hint): New hints.  SF Bug #477282.
	(all, install): Use the above hints.

	* configure.in: Changed all AC_CHECK_PROG(S)/AC_PATH_PROG(S) to

	isn't found.  Added AC_CHECK_AUCTEX.  Add note at end of configure
	to run "make".  SF Bug #469741 (partial).
	
	Removed --with-auctex since that's now done in AC_CHECK_AUCTEX.

2001-10-30  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* prv-emacs.el (preview-make-clickable): Use 'keymap instead of
	'local-map, obliterating the need to inherit from LaTeX-mode-map.
	(preview-toggle): Same here, and cater for null-length overlays.
	(preview-mark-point): Jury's still out on that one.

	* preview.el (preview-gs-sentinel): Don't hickup if buffer got
	killed.
	(preview-gs-restart): Don't mind exiting Emacs if GhostScript
	still running.
	(preview-snippet): Buffer-locality not needed because parsing
	occurs fully blocking.
	(preview-snippet-start): Same
	(preview-analyze-error): Somewhat saner behaviour if the error
	message parsing fails due to macro arguments or other.  This
	cannot be the final verdict.

	* TODO: add a few items.

	* prv-emacs.el (preview-transparent-color): Make transparency
	customizable.  Note that due to a bug everything except "None" is
	treated the same as "Autodetect" in 21.1.  Fixed in CVS.
	(preview-get-heuristic-mask): Function for calculating mask to use
	from above.
	(preview-create-icon): use preview-get-heuristic-mask
	(preview-ps-image): same.
	(preview-mark-point): move point out of previews before starting
	next command for consistent implementation of intangibility.  Not
	sure whether this is actually a good idea, though.

	(preview-gs-get-colors): New function, replaces preview-get-colors

	* preview.el (preview-gs): New customization group hierarchy
	(preview-appearance): same

	(preview-gs-colors): change string to single tokens.
	(preview-gs-transact): construct string from same

	of default.  Use new function preview-inherited-face-attribute for
	this.
	(preview-face): add different colours for dark backgrounds.
	change default background to beige, probably less likely to match
	users default background.
	(preview-error-face): change preview-error-face for non-color terms.
	(preview-reference-face): used for size and color determination of
	previews.
	(preview-TeX-inline-sentinel): tell user while we are parsing

2001-10-27  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* PROBLEMS: revert AucTeX patch to that before we tried our luck
	with intangibility.  Some changes in formatting.  Add comment
	about -Pwww font problems.

2001-10-26  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* Release 0.5.8.1

	* preview.el (preview-mouse-open-eps): fix a typo in help
	message.
	(preview-analyze-error): Remove traces of inhibit-point-motion
	madness.  If search for (concat string after-string) fails, try
	again just with string in order to support uses of Auc-TeX's
	original interface.

	* prv-emacs.el (preview-toggle): Don't reactivate disabled
	overlays (could happen in isearches ended by an editing operation).
	(preview-move-point): While we are simulating point-adjustment,
	heed disable-point-adjustment in order to make isearch (and
	probably other utilities) Do The Right Thing (TM).  Works
	beatifully.

	* preview.el (preview-LaTeX-command): new customization variable.
	(LaTeX-preview-setup): use it.

2001-10-25  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	font.

	* preview.el (preview-gs-colors): new variable for GhostScript
	color setup string.
	(preview-gs-transact): pass color setup.
	(preview-get-geometry): pass color setup

	* prv-emacs.el (preview-ps-image): Don't expect white background
	in heuristic-mask.

	* preview.el (preview-next-border): Can't get everything right
	first try now, can I?

	* prv-emacs.el: replace preview-intangible by preview-state.
	(preview-handle-insert-in-front): Same here.
	(preview-toggle): Same here.
	(preview-toggle): Let preview-toggle handle setting of category.
	That way category is not set/used outside of prv-emacs.el.
	(preview-move-point): replace preview-intangible by
	preview-state.
	
	* preview.el (preview-dwim): replaces preview-again.
	Excruciatingly useful function bound to C-c C-p C-p.  Will do just
	what you want whenever you call it.
	(preview-next-border): Helper-function for that
	(preview-disable): set property 'preview-state
	(preview-clearout): use 'preview-state instead of 'category
	(preview-place-preview): same here.

	(LaTeX-preview-setup): Add menus and keyboard shortcuts for new
	user functions.

	* prv-emacs.el: inherit from LaTeX-mode-map in order to have
	normal commands work when cursor is on preview.
	(preview-make-clickable): same.
	(preview-overlay): don't make intangible, but preview-intangible.
	In short, we now fake intangibility until Emacs will keep the
	cursor out of overlay images like it does out of text property
	images.
	(preview-handle-insert-in-front): Same here.
	(preview-toggle): Same here.  Load pre-command-hook and
	post-command-hook for fake intangibility.
	(preview-marker): Added for fake intangibility.
	(preview-mark-point): pre-command-hook function for fake
	intangibility.
	(preview-move-point): post-command-hook function for fakr
	intangibility.

2001-10-22  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* README: Change info for Emacs release 21.1

	* PROBLEMS: Change info for Emacs release 21.1

	* INSTALL: Change info for Emacs release 21.1

2001-10-19  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx (subsection{The internals}): Heed \AtBeginDvi
	sequences.  Small doc/formatting changes.

2001-10-17  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx: Get the version headers right (hopefully).

2001-10-16  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx: Make a stab at an automated version header
	(subsection{Preview attaching commands}): Move the badness stuff
	to the auctex option.

2001-10-15  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* prv-emacs.el:  insert-in-front back.  Discovered all-saving
	undo-in-progress.
	(preview-handle-insert-in-front): pseudo-advance if not in undo
	while iconized.
	(preview-handle-modification): fitting behaviour for that. commit
	suicide on changes that leave the range empty, disable else.

	* preview.el (preview-place-preview): overlays get auto-advancing
	front.
	(preview-analyze-error): intangible.  inhibit-point-motion-hooks.
	what a mess.  Made parsing saner in the presence of such stuff.
	(preview-place-preview): overlays get non-auto-advancing front
	back again, since we rather pseudo-advance in
	preview-handle-insert-in-front.

	* prv-emacs.el: don't handle insert-in-front: impossible to do
	consistently.  Instead make beginning ofg overlays auto-advance
	always.
	(preview-handle-insert-in-front): removed
	(preview-handle-modification): removed insert-in-front-hooks

2001-10-13  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* prv-xemacs.el: This is completely and utterly broken and
	incomplete.  The recent changes from Simon have not yet been
	incorporated, some of the stuff still has old semantics and so
	forth and so on.  One needs to go through prv-emacs.el and make
	sure that everything in there has an equivalent here.

	* prv-emacs.el: See preview.el.

	* preview.el: This is the big one.  Changes too numerous to
	mention.  Lots of modularization for making XEmacs support
	possible.  Changed semantics, the works.  See PROBLEMS file for
	new AucTeX compatibility annoyances.

	* PROBLEMS (AucTeX versions from 11.01 up to version 11.05): Patch
	added.  Patch for earlier versions revised.

2001-10-12  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx (subsection{Preview attaching commands}): set
	\hbadness and \vbadness to infinity in order to avoid
	parse-unfriendly error messages.  Would one want to see overfull
	hbox rules in preview output?

2001-10-12  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in (LISP_OBJS): New var.
	($(LISP_OBJS)): Got rid of elc target and used dependencies, so we
	don't recompile every make.

2001-10-12  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* configure.in: Try fixing the emacs flavor detection.
	And revert back to Alan's version.

2001-10-12  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Change AC_PATH_PROG of emacs to AC_CHECK_PROG, as
	it was breaking --with-xemacs.

2001-10-12  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Switch order of LISP_SOURCES in order to avoid
	compiling preview.el with older versions of prv-emacs.elc or
	prv-xemacs.elc

2001-10-11  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in (ELCC): Bug 469742: Include . in load path.

	* configure.in: Added --with-xemacs option.  Added AC_XEMACS_P to
	determine if we're using xemacs.  Added PLAT_LISP substitution
	with the flavor-specific lisp file.

	* Makefile.in (LISP_SOURCES): New variable, listing files needing
	byte-compilation.
	(all): Depend on "elc" target to capture all the emacs files.
	(install-el): Install more lisp files.
	(elc): New target, compile all relevant files.

2001-10-11  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx (subsection{The internals}): Introduce count
	\pr@snippet so as not to get confused by \include.
	(subsection{Preview attaching commands}): Make auctex option use
	this counter.

2001-10-10  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* circ.tex: Demonstrate new `sections' option.

	* preview.el (preview-default-option-list): Cater for new
	`sections' option to preview.sty.

	* preview.dtx (section{Provided Commands}): New argument syntax as
	in \PreviewMacro[{*[][]{}}]{\includegraphics}.
	(subsection{Parsing commands}): introduce \pr@endparse and support
	new syntax.
	(subsection{Preview attaching commands}): same here.
	(section{Package options}): explain new `sections' option.
	(subsection{Selection options}): implement `sections' option.

2001-10-09  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.el (preview-mouse-open-error): Don't have multiple
	"*Preview-GhostScript-Error*" buffers gather, reuse single one.
	(LaTeX-preview-setup): Enter us into "Command" menu.

2001-10-08  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx (subsection{Preview attaching commands}): Change
	output routine to flush out floats.
	Correct \CheckSum.

	* preview.el: Use `error' identifier only where really needed.
	(preview-gs-behead-outstanding): see above.
	(preview-gs-sentinel): see above.
	(preview-gs-flag-error): see above.
	Still require (defvar error) because of Auc-TeX
	(TeX-active-tempdir): Move definition.
	(preview-gs-place, preview-eps-place)
	(preview-active-string, preview-make-filename)
	(preview-place-preview, preview-parse-messages)
	(preview-analyze-error): remove `tempdir' argument
	(preview-get-geometry): some change in semantics
	(preview-TeX-inline-sentinel): call `preview-parse-messages' with
	process buffer active instead of source.
	(TeX-inline-preview): adapt to changed `preview-get-geometry'

2001-10-07  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.el (preview-get-geometry): comment clarification to
	satisfy checkdoc.
	(preview-version): added.
	(preview-report-bug): use `preview-version' instead of current
	ugliness.

	* .cvsignore (Module): Add a few more entries.

	* preview.el: Don't defvar AucTeX internal TeX-auto-file, make
	auto-size detection of previews from parsed styles work.
	(preview-document-pt): Use `TeX-active-styles' instead of bad AucTeX
	internal `TeX-auto-file'.
	(preview-get-geometry): Different arguments and semantics.  Make
	it work.
	(TeX-inline-preview): Call changed `preview-get-geometry'.

	* prv-xemacs.el: add macros line-beginning-position and
	line-end-position.

	* preview.el: Change manner of loading prv-xemacs
	(preview-analyze-error): Use line-end-position again.

2001-10-05  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.dtx: Include \ProvidesPackage and \CheckSum
	(subsection{Preview attaching commands}): put \unskip in
	\end{preview} where it will make a difference.

	* prv-xemacs.el: require overlay
	preview-compatibility-macros added
	(find-image): some changes of compilation
	(defimage): define using preview-defmacro

2001-10-04  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.el: first stab at XEmacs compatibility.

	* prv-xemacs.el: first stab at XEmacs compatibility.

	* circ.tex (section{Die gerade Linie}): built in two deliberate
	bugs for testing.

	* preview.el (preview-gs-behead-outstanding): use
	`preview-gs-flag-error'.
	(preview-mouse-open-error, preview-mouse-open-eps): factored out
	stuff from `preview-gs-flag-error'.
	(preview-gs-flag-error): replaces `preview-gs-error-string'
	(preview-gs-transact): Use `preview-gs-flag-error'.

	* PROBLEMS: be more specific about GhostScript errors

2001-10-03  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	(preview-make-filename): remove dont-register
	(preview-regenerate): switch to clicked buffer if not there.
	(preview-gs-error-string): try to avoid strange behaviour from
	having `let' restore potential buffer-local-variables to the wrong
	buffer.  Make some functions (interactive "@").

2001-10-02  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

        * release 0.5

	* PROBLEMS: Completed summary of patches and made an outline-mode file.

	* INSTALL:
	Gearing up for a release.  Last modifications and clarifications.

	* preview.el:
	Lots of cleanups for getting to release quality.  Made good error
	reporting with things masquerading as actual GhostScript sessions,
	including command line, prompt, messages, the works.

	Removed preview-gs-urgent which actually has never been anything
	but the front of preview-gs-queue.

	* TODO: Some more wishes.

	* preview.el: Make active error display.

	* preview.el:
	Changed the process line appearance somewhat, added a bit of
	robustness when error line parsing fails, beautified appearance of
	opened previews (icon gets its own line only when previewed area
	starts on a line).

2001-10-01  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: Added a few items.

	* README: Added CVS instructions and a few other odds and ends.

	* bootstrap.ins: Remove docstrip configuration related messages.

	* INSTALL: Some more massaging.

	* PROBLEMS: Initial checkin, preparation for first tarball release.

	* ChangeLog: Initial entry of ChangeLog.

2001-10-01  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* aclocal.m4: Instead of /dev/null, throw stuff to FD 5, where it
	might do some good.

2001-09-30  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Mentioned M-x preview-report-bug.

	* README: Removed redundancies with INSTALL, cleared some stuff up.

	* preview.el:
	Obliterated transaction queues.  They did not help that much, and are
	not implemented in earlier versions of XEmacs.  More trouble than they
	were worth, anyway.

	* preview.el: Define a few more image types.

2001-09-29  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL: Some general information and stuff.

	* Makefile.in:
	Use latex '\nonstopmode \input ...' instead of -interaction
	nonstopmode

	Fixed string comparison in Emacs.

	* aclocal.m4:
	Remove trailing slashes after path discovery, do some more things with
	sed instead of various other utilities.  One change in calling LaTeX
	to make it work with older or non-web2c binaries.

	* preview.dtx:
	Support those misguided people using $$ in their LaTeX documents.  I
	am not sure this is a good idea, but it will probably save us bug
	reports.

	* TODO: Removed a few done points.

	* preview.el:
	Made parsing good.  Now the entire TeX error context gets used.  In
	most cases, regenerating previews should work now, as well as region
	previewing.

2001-09-28  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL: New file

2001-09-27  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (preview.elc): Patch from Simon Josefsson to fix
	build with non-standard AUCTeX location.

2001-09-27  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Made error and abort messages appear in the faulty images.  Reworked
	file handling somewhat so that in the case of errors all involved
	files can stay until the image overlay gets deleted.

	* preview.el:
	Added bug reporting instructions and helper function for reports
	to preview-latex-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net.

2001-09-26  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in: (install-texmf) Install the dvi file

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in:
	* aclocal.m4: Removed some dross stolen from Gnus, since it is unused.
	Fixed up AC_PATH_TEXMFDIR to try to find a dir to install the docs
	and to export texmfdir.

	* configure.in: --with-auctex=DIR, new option

	* Makefile.in: Changed rules for byte-compilation to allow setting
	AUCTEXDIR.
	(install-texmf) Only texhash the directory we installed into

2001-09-26  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Oodles of documentation and a much faster bounding box extractor
	not relying on grep.  Some small internal changes.

	* preview.el:
	Background rendering now working without errors, even with crummy
	default tq.el as currently shipped with Emacs (and XEmacs?).

2001-09-25  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Some initial stab at trying to make do without tq.el.  Figured out a
	way to make do with tq's ugly semantics, however.  Just keep this
	somewhere.  Only half done.

2001-09-24  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in:
	Makefile.in: clean and distclean targets from Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com>

2001-09-24  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Sanitized temporary file handling by introducing a reference count
	scheme.  Temporary directories should now get deleted as they become
	empty.  We still do a general cleanup (in case a previous EMacs
	session crashed) on first accessing any preview subdirectory, which
	means bad luck when you are starting multiple instances of Emacs for
	previewing purposes.

2001-09-24  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:
	Run texhash after tex installation.  Also set full
	pathnames for programs, since the path of the installing user may
	not match the compiling user.

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4: First cut at previewdocdir

2001-09-24  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	PNG rendering now basically works and is the default.  Errors during
	transaction queue processing insert their messages into the TeX
	background buffer; so do unexpected GhostScript messages.  Good for
	debugging.

2001-09-22  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Forgot entering into queue and a condition.  Still does not work with png.

	* preview.dtx: Fixed \begin{table} bug.

	* preview.el: Several changes from several people.

	The big one: support of other image formats. PNG.  Unfortunately, not
	yet functional.  Checked in nevertheless since the old postscript
	rendering is on by default and seems to work still.

	* preview.dtx: Forgotten macrocode, empty line.

2001-09-21  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in:
	2001-09-21  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

		* aclocal.m4: Correct handling of docstrip configuration for
		non-TDS setup.  Also, quote the $ in awk.

		* Makefile.in (TEX): New variable.
		(all): preview-mk.ins instead of preview.ins
		(preview-mk.ins, preview.sty prauctex.def preview.drv): Use $TEX.

		* configure.in: Added --with-preview-dir option.  Check for tex
		executable.

	* configure.in: Clarified --with-texmf help.

	* README: Updated build directions for autoconf build.

	* .cvsignore, Makefile, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in, install-sh:
	Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in: Create autoconf versions of
	Makefile.  Much of aclocal.m4 was stolen from Gnus, though the
	AC_PATH_TEXMF is new.

	Added install-sh for use by the makefile if a compatible install
	binary is not found.

2001-09-20  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: First sketch at installation via make instead of docstrip.

	* bootstrap.ins: No error if no docstrip.cfg.

	* bootstrap.ins:
	First sketch at bootstrap install file for extracting main installer
	and giving directory info.

	* preview.dtx: Added missing macrocode environment (David Love).
	Leave directory off installer when installing via make.

2001-09-19  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Checked in antialiasing suggestions from Alan Shutko.

2001-09-16  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el: Still learning about customize-variable...

2001-09-15  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Parse HiRes Bounding Boxes, remove accidental paste of definition of
	shell-command-to-string, add support for graphical preview of files
	not prepared for it.

	* preview.dtx: Another spurious space.

	* preview.dtx:
	AucTeX option delays \nonstopmode.  Spurious space in \pr@endbox removed.

	* README: Add instructions for anti-aliasing.

	* preview.dtx, README: Corrected Email address.

2001-09-14  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Added some more descriptive stuff and my Email address.

	* preview.el: Added intelligent determination of EPS scale.
	Changed Bounding Box determination to use a HiResBoundingBox if
	present, and work without a shell.
	Added some customization.

2001-09-13  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore generated files.

	* preview.dtx:
	Deleted no longer applicable comment.  Fixed bug in connection with \item.

	* COPYING: Copy of GPL version 2 included.

	* README: Typo.

	* README: Clarified comment about how to improve EPS support in Emacs.

	* README: Removed link to pretest Emacs on request from Gerd Möllmann.

2001-09-12  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* circ.tex: New file.

	* circ.tex: This is the initial checkin of preview-latex.  Enjoy.

	* Makefile, README, TODO, preview.dtx: New file.

	* Makefile, README, TODO, preview.dtx:
	This is the initial checkin of preview-latex.  Enjoy.
