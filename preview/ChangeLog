	it was breaking --with-xemacs.

2001-10-12  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Switch order of LISP_SOURCES in order to avoid
	compiling preview.el with older versions of prv-emacs.elc or
	prv-xemacs.elc

2001-10-11  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in (ELCC): Bug 469742: Include . in load path.

	satisfy checkdoc.
	(preview-version): added.
	(preview-report-bug): use `preview-version' instead of current
	ugliness.

	* .cvsignore (Module): Add a few more entries.

	* preview.el: Don't defvar AucTeX internal TeX-auto-file, make
	auto-size detection of previews from parsed styles work.
	(preview-document-pt): Use `TeX-active-styles' instead of bad AucTeX
	internal `TeX-auto-file'.

	(defimage): define using preview-defmacro
	(make-temp-file): ignore temporary-filename: not needed in here.

2001-10-04  David Kastrup  <David.Kastrup@t-online.de>

	* preview.el: first stab at XEmacs compatibility.

	* prv-xemacs.el: first stab at XEmacs compatibility.

	* circ.tex (section{Die gerade Linie}): built in two deliberate
	bugs for testing.

	* preview.el (preview-gs-behead-outstanding): use
	`preview-gs-flag-error'.
	(preview-mouse-open-error, preview-mouse-open-eps): factored out
	stuff from `preview-gs-flag-error'.
	(preview-gs-flag-error): replaces `preview-gs-error-string'
	(preview-gs-transact): Use `preview-gs-flag-error'.

	* PROBLEMS: be more specific about GhostScript errors

2001-10-02  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

        * release 0.5

	* PROBLEMS: Completed summary of patches and made an outline-mode file.

	* INSTALL:
	Gearing up for a release.  Last modifications and clarifications.

	* preview.el:
	Lots of cleanups for getting to release quality.  Made good error
	reporting with things masquerading as actual GhostScript sessions,
	including command line, prompt, messages, the works.

	Removed preview-gs-urgent which actually has never been anything
	but the front of preview-gs-queue.

	* TODO: Some more wishes.

	* preview.el: Make active error display.

	* preview.el:
	Changed the process line appearance somewhat, added a bit of
	robustness when error line parsing fails, beautified appearance of
	opened previews (icon gets its own line only when previewed area
	starts on a line).

2001-10-01  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: Added a few items.

	* README: Added CVS instructions and a few other odds and ends.

	* bootstrap.ins: Remove docstrip configuration related messages.

	* INSTALL: Some more massaging.

	* PROBLEMS: Initial checkin, preparation for first tarball release.

	* ChangeLog: Initial entry of ChangeLog.

2001-10-01  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* aclocal.m4: Instead of /dev/null, throw stuff to FD 5, where it
	might do some good.

2001-09-30  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Mentioned M-x preview-report-bug.

	* README: Removed redundancies with INSTALL, cleared some stuff up.

	* preview.el:
	Obliterated transaction queues.  They did not help that much, and are
	not implemented in earlier versions of XEmacs.  More trouble than they
	were worth, anyway.

	* preview.el: Define a few more image types.

2001-09-29  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL: Some general information and stuff.

	* Makefile.in:
	Use latex '\nonstopmode \input ...' instead of -interaction
	nonstopmode

	Fixed string comparison in Emacs.

	* aclocal.m4:
	Remove trailing slashes after path discovery, do some more things with
	sed instead of various other utilities.  One change in calling LaTeX
	to make it work with older or non-web2c binaries.

	* preview.dtx:
	Support those misguided people using $$ in their LaTeX documents.  I
	am not sure this is a good idea, but it will probably save us bug
	reports.

	* TODO: Removed a few done points.

	* preview.el:
	Made parsing good.  Now the entire TeX error context gets used.  In
	most cases, regenerating previews should work now, as well as region
	previewing.

2001-09-28  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL: New file

2001-09-27  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (preview.elc): Patch from Simon Josefsson to fix
	build with non-standard AUCTeX location.

2001-09-27  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Made error and abort messages appear in the faulty images.  Reworked
	file handling somewhat so that in the case of errors all involved
	files can stay until the image overlay gets deleted.

	* preview.el:
	Added bug reporting instructions and helper function for reports
	to preview-latex-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net.

2001-09-26  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in: (install-texmf) Install the dvi file

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in:
	* aclocal.m4: Removed some dross stolen from Gnus, since it is unused.
	Fixed up AC_PATH_TEXMFDIR to try to find a dir to install the docs
	and to export texmfdir.

	* configure.in: --with-auctex=DIR, new option

	* Makefile.in: Changed rules for byte-compilation to allow setting
	AUCTEXDIR.
	(install-texmf) Only texhash the directory we installed into

2001-09-26  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Oodles of documentation and a much faster bounding box extractor
	not relying on grep.  Some small internal changes.

	* preview.el:
	Background rendering now working without errors, even with crummy
	default tq.el as currently shipped with Emacs (and XEmacs?).

2001-09-25  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Some initial stab at trying to make do without tq.el.  Figured out a
	way to make do with tq's ugly semantics, however.  Just keep this
	somewhere.  Only half done.

2001-09-24  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in:
	Makefile.in: clean and distclean targets from Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com>

2001-09-24  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Sanitized temporary file handling by introducing a reference count
	scheme.  Temporary directories should now get deleted as they become
	empty.  We still do a general cleanup (in case a previous EMacs
	session crashed) on first accessing any preview subdirectory, which
	means bad luck when you are starting multiple instances of Emacs for
	previewing purposes.

2001-09-24  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:
	Run texhash after tex installation.  Also set full
	pathnames for programs, since the path of the installing user may
	not match the compiling user.

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4: First cut at previewdocdir

2001-09-24  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	PNG rendering now basically works and is the default.  Errors during
	transaction queue processing insert their messages into the TeX
	background buffer; so do unexpected GhostScript messages.  Good for
	debugging.

2001-09-22  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Forgot entering into queue and a condition.  Still does not work with png.

	* preview.dtx: Fixed \begin{table} bug.

	* preview.el: Several changes from several people.

	The big one: support of other image formats. PNG.  Unfortunately, not
	yet functional.  Checked in nevertheless since the old postscript
	rendering is on by default and seems to work still.

	* preview.dtx: Forgotten macrocode, empty line.

2001-09-21  alanshutko  <alanshutko@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in:
	2001-09-21  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

		* aclocal.m4: Correct handling of docstrip configuration for
		non-TDS setup.  Also, quote the $ in awk.

		* Makefile.in (TEX): New variable.
		(all): preview-mk.ins instead of preview.ins
		(preview-mk.ins, preview.sty prauctex.def preview.drv): Use $TEX.

		* configure.in: Added --with-preview-dir option.  Check for tex
		executable.

	* configure.in: Clarified --with-texmf help.

	* README: Updated build directions for autoconf build.

	* .cvsignore, Makefile, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in, install-sh:
	Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in: Create autoconf versions of
	Makefile.  Much of aclocal.m4 was stolen from Gnus, though the
	AC_PATH_TEXMF is new.

	Added install-sh for use by the makefile if a compatible install
	binary is not found.

2001-09-20  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: First sketch at installation via make instead of docstrip.

	* bootstrap.ins: No error if no docstrip.cfg.

	* bootstrap.ins:
	First sketch at bootstrap install file for extracting main installer
	and giving directory info.

	* preview.dtx: Added missing macrocode environment (David Love).
	Leave directory off installer when installing via make.

2001-09-19  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Checked in antialiasing suggestions from Alan Shutko.

2001-09-16  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el: Still learning about customize-variable...

2001-09-15  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* preview.el:
	Parse HiRes Bounding Boxes, remove accidental paste of definition of
	shell-command-to-string, add support for graphical preview of files
	not prepared for it.

	* preview.dtx: Another spurious space.

	* preview.dtx:
	AucTeX option delays \nonstopmode.  Spurious space in \pr@endbox removed.

	* README: Add instructions for anti-aliasing.

	* preview.dtx, README: Corrected Email address.

2001-09-14  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Added some more descriptive stuff and my Email address.

	* preview.el: Added intelligent determination of EPS scale.
	Changed Bounding Box determination to use a HiResBoundingBox if
	present, and work without a shell.
	Added some customization.

2001-09-13  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore generated files.

	* preview.dtx:
	Deleted no longer applicable comment.  Fixed bug in connection with \item.

	* COPYING: Copy of GPL version 2 included.

	* README: Typo.

	* README: Clarified comment about how to improve EPS support in Emacs.

	* README: Removed link to pretest Emacs on request from Gerd Möllmann.

2001-09-12  David Kastrup  <dakas@users.sourceforge.net>

	* circ.tex: New file.

	* circ.tex: This is the initial checkin of preview-latex.  Enjoy.

	* Makefile, README, TODO, preview.dtx: New file.

	* Makefile, README, TODO, preview.dtx:
	This is the initial checkin of preview-latex.  Enjoy.

	* preview.el: New file.

	* preview.el: This is the initial checkin of preview-latex.  Enjoy.
